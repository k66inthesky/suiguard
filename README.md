## üöÄ Why we build SuiAudit?

## How to join as Member? (Below we referred you as `candidate`)

### Recruitment Process:

1. Fill in the [form](https://forms.gle/oE3AUChoMqkhruD79), duration: 30 min.
2. `Candidate` needs to raise an issue using the tag `join as member`, with title [Join As Member], and use the same email when filling out the form, so we can speed up the process.
3. We will email the `candidate` to schedule a virtual interview. Please make sure you will attend (normally we interview once a month, it will be announced in this `README`).
4. We will ask questions based on the information filled out by the `candidate`. We want to learn about you and your motivation, to make sure you and SuiAudit Lab have the same goal, and to avoid false expectations from the `candidate`.
5. During the interview, we have a small break, during which core team members will evaluate each `candidate` based on a 1-10 score evaluation. Those scoring above 8 will join as `members`. We will announce the result immediately.
6. Evaluation Period: `candidate` and `core team` will need to work together for a month, during which the `candidate` needs to deliver the assigned tasks on time.
7. During the evaluation period, if the `candidate` underperforms (e.g., incomplete tasks, late for meetings for more than 10 minutes without giving notice in advance...), we will DM you and kindly ask you to leave the meeting.
8. The `core team` will evaluate based on the `candidate`'s performance. Those scoring above 8 will become members of SuiAudit Lab, and we will list you on this README and announce at our next meeting.

### Interview Dates:

- `Core team members` will post available interview dates here. `Candidates` should select one date from the list. No alternative times will be offered, so please clear your schedule accordingly.
- Interviews are scheduled at month-end when maximum `core team members` are available.

### Evaluation Period To Become A Member

- About one month(will adjust due to product roadmap or upcoming events)
  > eg. Interviewed on Sep. 28, but ended evaluation period on Oct. 22 due to HoH hackathon.
- At the end of every month, all `core team member` fill in a review form to decide whether `candidate` will become a `member` at SuiAudit Lab.
